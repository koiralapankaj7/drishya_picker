## 2.0.0-dev 
DrishyaPicker is on the verge of being a fully customizable package 

- **Breaking**: `DrishyaEntity` now extends `AssetEntity` and some field has been removed for performance optimization.
- **Breaking**: `GalleryViewWrapper` has been replaced by `SlidableGallery`
- **Breaking**: `GalleryController` will not take parameters anymore. Now, you can pass settings while picking the assets.
- **Added**: Default stickers for the editor section have been removed. Now you have to provide your own stickers which makes the editor more customizable and unique. You can implement `Sticker` class to make your own sticker or just use already available stickers. E.g, `IconSticker`, `ImageSticker` and `TextSticker`. 
- **Added**: Same as stickers now you can provide your own background and color settings for the editor. You can also make your own background. Implement `EditorBackground` to make your own background or use the default one provided by the package. E.g, `GradientBackground`, `MemoryAssetBackground`, and 
`DrishyaBackground`.
- **Added**: Now you can use `GalleryView`, `CameraView`, and `DrishyaEditor` independently with full customization support.

- **General**: All available API has been made public now.
- **General**: To see what else this package has to offer, please visit the example app.

**Warning**: The license has been updated. Now, author permission is required, if you are re-publishing this package in `pub.dev` just by renaming the packages or with minor changes.
